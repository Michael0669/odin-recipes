    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable Oil For Frying</li>
        <li>4 Cups of Fresh Flower</li>
        <li>6 Tablespoons of Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>4 Large Eggs, Beaten</li>
        <li>8 Skinless, Boneless Chicken Breast</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 inch oil in a large skillet or saucepan to 
            350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Stir together flour, garlic salt, and pepper in a 
            bowl. Dip chicken pieces into beaten eggs, then press 
            each piece into flour mixture to coat well; shake off excess 
            flour. Place coated chicken pieces onto a plate.</li>

        <li>Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil until golden 
            brown and no longer pink in the center. An instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 
            165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
