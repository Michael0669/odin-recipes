            <ul>
                <li>3 Cups Fresh Flower</li>
                <li>2 Cups Filtered Water</li>
                <li>5 Fresh Tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 Package Fresh Cut Pepparoni</li>
                <li>1/4 Stick Organic Butter</li>

                <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier. Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>

                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
