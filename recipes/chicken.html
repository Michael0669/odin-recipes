    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breast, Legs, & Wings</li>
        <li>4 Cups of Fresh Buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 Cups All Purpose flour</li>
        <li>Herbs & Spices</li>
        <li>2 Cups Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag.
             Seal the bag and shake until well-combined.</li>

        <li>Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the 
            chicken (on both sides) until it's completely 
            soaked in buttermilk. Place the soaked chicken in 
            the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat. 
            Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and 
            cover. Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like consistency.
        </li>

        <li>Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. 
            Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat, 
            cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes. Remove 
            the cover, return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy. 
            Drain the chicken on paper towels.
        </li>
    </ol>
